# Tims-Python-Toolbox
Kind of like a journal, but for pythony things. It's a place where I can add things I've learned I think are cool, like `enumerate()` or concatenating dictionaries with aswesome one-liners like `concat_dict = {**dict_1, **dict_2}`.

I'm not gonna pretend like I'll add to this daily, but I'll try to add to it often.

Enjoy :)
