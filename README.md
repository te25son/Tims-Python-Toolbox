Kind of like a journal, but for pythony things. It's a place where I can add things I've learned I think are cool, like `enumerate()` or concatenating dictionaries with aswesome one-liners like `concat_dict = {**dict_1, **dict_2}`.

This is really to help me better understand the things I learn, but maybe you'll find some of the things here interesting too.

You can also check it out on [my personal website](http://www.timpeason.com/toolbox/)

Enjoy :)
